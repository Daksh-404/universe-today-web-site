      <p class="introduction-head"> Nietzsche juxtaposed two quite challenging sentences however no other words could have described it better.
        Space is the void, a crucible of burning hot stars, rapidly rotating Neutron stars and the monsters of Space-Time,
        Blackholes themselves. We gaze upon the night sky wondering ever so often, not only questions about our own existence but,
        of the Universe itself. Here on this site, it's my agenda to provide you with all the best resources to update yourself with
      the latest news, information and technology in the field of Astronomy. We have everything ranging from Picture of the Day(APOD)
    to Astronomy equipment reviews from experts around the world. Universe Today is your one and all pit stop for all the interesting
  bits and bites of this mysterious cosmos, as we never know who might be gazing back?</p><br><br>

  <p class="introduction-head">Astronomy is the oldest science, with the first observations of the heavens conducted by our early human ancestors. Historical records of astronomical measurements date back as far as Mesopotamia nearly 5000 years ago, with later observations made by the ancient Chinese, Babylonians, and Greeks. Humans seek to explain their world with (internal) models; one of the earliest is that the affairs of humans and the world are controlled by the positions of the stars and planets. Although astrology is now regarded as a psuedoscience, it was the original motivation for the mapping of the stars and the assignment of constellations.</p><br>

<p class="introduction-head">Astronomy is more than simply a mapping of stars and planets into outlines of gods and magical creatures. It is the scientific study of the contents of entire Universe; stars, planets, comets, asteroids, galaxies, and space and time as well as its history.</p>

    <p class="topic-headers">Astronomy Blogs:</p><p class="content"><b>Recently I attended my first book launch: Marcus Chown's What A Wonderful World. It took place in a bookshop near Holland Park. There were vast tables of books, a great many about travel and cookery. There were a few tables of wine, juice, and nibbles. And there was Marcus, helping get everything ready. His publicity agent, Ruth Killick, remarked to me, "I've never worked with anyone as lovely as Marcus. Most writers don't pitch in and help set everything up the way he does!". Among the guests were Simon Singh and Nigel Henbest - who had a nasty bump on his head from a recent zero gravity experience, and who I was able to thank for writing The Space Atlas with Heather Couper, my second childhood astronomy book that really got me hooked. There was also Marcus's editor Neil Belton. In their speeches, they told the story of how Neil pushed Marcus to "go outside his comfort zone" and write a book not about his usual physics and astronomy, but about "everything": biology, evolution, geology, economics - generally how human society, and our planet and Universe, have come to be the way they are.</b><a href="http://aliceingalaxyland.blogspot.com/" class="links">Read More</a></p>

    <p class="topic-headers">Astronomy Equipment Review:</p><p class="content"><b>I have been doing astrophotography for 35 years. I started with film, then moved to film plus computers, and now I’m doing pure digital with CCD cameras. I’ve used telescopes of every type and size: Newtonians, Cassegrains, Ritchey-Chrétiens, and refractors. And each one had its own quirks. Some were hard to collimate; some changed their collimation when pointed to different parts of the sky; some defocused at the mere suggestion of temperature change; and some were not truly apochromatic, meaning all three colors were not focused at the same point.

  All of this changed three months ago when I took possession of a PlaneWave CDK17 with quartz optics. I have never owned a telescope that worked perfectly, right out of the box. But even after a 400-mile (644 kilometers) journey from Los Angeles to my home in Foresthill, California, with the scope bouncing in the back of my pickup, the collimation was still perfect. Furthermore, when I point this telescope anywhere in the sky and turn it upside down — still no change.</b><a href="https://astronomy.com/magazine/product-reviews/2018/12/testing-planewaves-17-inch-scope" class="links">Read More</a></p>

      <p class="topic-headers">Debunking Hoaxes:</p><p class="content"><b>In what has become an annual tradition, a hoax is circulating on social media and email chains saying that on Thursday night “Mars will look as large as the full moon” and “no one alive will ever see this again.”

  If you do happen to go outside looking for Mars tonight, don’t be surprised if you see absolutely nothing. Zilch. Zero. Nada.

  Unfortunately, the red planet will be more than 150 million miles away from home and simply not in the night sky that day.

  What’s curious is why this hoax has persisted all these years. NASA's public relations department has been repeatedly debunking the myth for years.

  Mars has been an object of human fascination since its discovery, from the Roman god of war to H.G. Wells’ War of the Worlds, the planet’s similarities to Earth gives it a special place in the celestial pantheon."When you put it in the perspective of, Mars may have had life at some point, or Mars is this complete other world that we've sent spacecraft to, maybe the idea that Mars will be as big as the moon doesn't sound so crazy," Joshua Bandfield, a senior research scientist at the Space Science Institute and the University of Washington, told Live Science.</b>
