# Universe-today-web-site

I have started creating this website to explore not only web development, but also to create a site which hosts all different kind of information about astronomy. This platform has the sources/ links to all the major fields of astronomy. This site is one and all stop for all "AstroNews" "Astrotalk" for all the people obsessed with the beauty of this magnificent universe. The site is obviously not complete, and page2 and page 3 still need to be designed. The site is not available in phone mode as of now, because I haven't used Bootstrap as a challenge to myself. However in future versions, and updates I will add Bootstrap and many other front end features to make it more appealing and responsive.
